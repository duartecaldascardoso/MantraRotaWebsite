# Mantra Rota

This is the repository for the Mantra Rota Website. 

I made the website using Mithril.js - check their docs: https://mithril.js.org/
Feel free to message me if you have doubts in the source code. 

This was a side project I did for the band to give us visibility and to better explain our vision and mission.
If you have any idea or feature suggestion, feel free to talk to me about it.
