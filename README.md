# MantraRotaWebsite

This is the repository for the Mantra Rota Website. 

I made the website using Mithril.js - https://mithril.js.org/index.html which I really appreaciated. I got to know mithril.js by following the videos from https://www.youtube.com/@withmarko where he explained what I experienced - due to being such a lightweight framework, once you learn to build with it you will not unlearn it. The source code from mithril is amazingly short and at the same time useful, give it a try!

The website currently contains 3 pages and should be easy to understand - as it is just a canvas. 

Feel free to message me if you have doubts in the source code.
